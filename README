L3: experiments in aggressive garbage collection and Pratt-parser based interpreter.



compilation/build notes:

 Originally prototyped the LLVM links with llvm-2.8; later versions of LLVM (2.9, 3.0, etc) probably won't work.
 The LLVM stuff can be omitted (deleted); although we got to initialization, the rest of it isn't implemented/used
 in the current working interpreter.
